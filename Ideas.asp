						<li>Altiniyan al’Azarq<br>
							<ol start="50" style="margin-left: 30px;">
								<li>An ancient blue dragon</li>
								<li>AKA: the Whispering Death, She of the Storm, The Unseen Ravenger, Storm Bringer</li>


								<li>History
									<ol start="50" style="margin-left: 30px;">
										<li>Years ago, having gorged herself on the people of the Steppes, she returned to her lair, and like any reptile with a bloated belly, fell into a deep sleep</li>
										<li>A long deep sleep</li>
										<li>A sleep that lasted over 40 years</li>
										<li>So long in fact that the people of the Dry Steppes have assumed she was dead or had moved on</li>
										<li>Few who have seen her have survived, so much of what is spoken of her in hushed tones is rumor</li>
										<li>Many do not believe she ever existed, especially those too young to have witnessed the destruction of her attacks</li>
										<li>Parents tell tales of the Whispering Death to their children to frighten them</li>
									</ol>
								</li>

								<li>Backstory
									<ol start="50" style="margin-left: 30px;">
										<li>Altiniyan al’Azarq is a very intelligent, calculating and patient creature, willing to observe her prey for hours or even days before making her attack, but when she attacks, she is ruthless and unstoppable</li>
										<li>For meals, she prefers ponies, but will happily snap up any hapless people she encounters</li>
										<li>Her scales are thick, dark blue and crackle with static just before using her deadly breath attack</li>
										<li>The sweet smell of ozone fills the air during and after a recent attack</li>
									</ol>
								</li>

								<li>Attacks
									<ol start="50" style="margin-left: 30px;">
										<li>Like other ancient dragons, Altiniyan al’Azarq is inherently magical and has learned to use spells and employs it to great effect in her attacks against the helpless people on the Steppes</li>
										<li>Spells
											<ol start="50" style="margin-left: 30px;">
												<li>Chain Lightning – range: 150’, hit 1 target, then from it, 3 more bolts to any target within 30 of the original targets - 10d8 Lightning, DC 20 DEX save for half damage</li>
												<li>Darkness – range 60’, 15’ radius, duration: 10 minutes, concentration</li>
												<li>Detect Magic</li>
												<li>Dimension Door – 500’ teleport</li>
												<li>Greater Invisibility – duration: 1 minute, concentration</li>
											</ol>
										</li>
										<li>Altiniyan al’Azarq is a calculating creature and does not attack unless she is sure to win</li>
										<li>She usually waits for a natural storm to form (esp. at night), then under the cover of these dark storm clouds, she uses Greater Invisibility to swiftly fly into a community, unleashing her deadly breath attack and attacking with her powerful claws and jaws as she strafes her targets, none of whom can see her, but hear the whoosh of her wings</li>
										<li>After softening up her targets, she will land and begin killing and destroying everything in sight</li>
										<li>Using her Frightful Gaze, most people are helpless as she charges in killing left and right</li>
										<li>When convinced all are dead and/or eaten, she flies away to digest for a week or so before launching another sneak attack</li>
									</ol>
								</li>

								<li>Lair Region
									<ol start="50" style="margin-left: 30px;">
										<li>The region out to 6 miles around Altiniyan al’Azarq’s lair is pitted with deadly sink holes and thunderstorms rage</li>
										<li>Mindless air elements, often mistaken for large dust devils, regularly wander about</li>
										<li>These conditions tend to drive away (or kill) all but the bravest (or most foolish) of souls</li>
										<li>Locals attribute these phenomena as a place cursed by the gods, calling it “The Cursed” – referring to the storms, the elements and sinkholes alike</li>
									</ol>
								</li>

								<li>Awakened
									<ol start="50" style="margin-left: 30px;">
										<li>However, a party of Paynim recently managed to work their way through these dangers and find the great worm’s lair, a massive cave complex with a huge opening in the ground</li>
										<li>Descending by ropes down into the dark pit, they began exploring the cavern below, ultimately finding the mounds of treasure of the great worm</li>
										<li>Unknown to these explorers, they had managed to awaken Altiniyan al’Azarq with their cries of joy at finding the heaps of wealth</li>
										<li>Though sluggish at first (having been asleep for so long), the dragon observed these intruders as they obliviously cheered at their good fortune</li>
										<li>Suddenly, and without warning, Altiniyan al’Azarq attacked, killing all of the intruders in a matter of moments</li>
										<li>Now awake and hungry after her decades of slumber, the ancient dragon began searching for food</li>
										<li>She has been attacking the people of the Steppes for several weeks now, moving from place to place, preferring to attack at night and during a storm<br><br></li>

							<li>Brief history
								<ul class="circle" style="margin-left: 40px;">
									<li>Of the Creation of the Genie
										<ul class="circle" style="margin-left: 40px;">
											<li>The gods emerge from the void, crafting the elemental planes to forms of their liking</li>
											<li>These planes are filled with formless spirits</li>
											<li><%=Anumon%> created the first genie, <%=Sulymon%> from one of these formless spirit</li>
											<li><%=Sulymon%> is given many tasks, including the creation of other genies</li>
											<li>The genies are the servants of the gods, known as the 1st children, are commanded to begin creating the universe</li>
										</ul>
									</li>

									<li>Of the Crafting of the <%=Mudawwarah_Al_Jin%>
										<ul class="circle" style="margin-left: 40px;">
											<li><%=Sulymon%> proposes a great city, <%=Mudawwarah_Al_Jin%>, for his people - the gods agree
												<ul class="circle" style="margin-left: 40px;">
													<li>The children of air have no interest in a city, preferring to freedom on the winds</li>
													<li>The children of water have little interest, knowing that all waters will eventually flow to them</li>
													<li>Thus, the children of earth and fire are the primary builders of the great city</li>
												</ul>
											</li>
											<li><%=Sulymon%>'s city is made of gold, silver, gems, jewelry and lapis lazuli</li>
											<li>The city was given to the the genies as thanks, but in accepting, the genies became mortal</li>
											<li>Some of the genies seethed with anger at being made mortal</li>
											<li><%=Sulymon%> placed <%=Iblis%>, the first genie he created, on the throne of <%=Mudawwarah_Al_Jin%></li>
											<li>The city stood for thousands of year, the genies living together in peace</li>
											<li>As <%=Mudawwarah_Al_Jin%> grew, so too did the house of <%=Iblis%> as did their arrogance</li>
											<li>As the creation grew to a close, the house of <%=Iblis%> began to make demands on the <%=Djinn%>, <%=Marid%> and jann</li>
										</ul>
									</li>

									<li>Of the Great Purge and the Exodus of the <%=Djinn%>
										<ul class="circle" style="margin-left: 40px;">
											<li><%=Iblis%> took many wives from the houses of the genies, siring a host of <%=Efreeti%></li>
											<li>Me also sired many children out of wedlock, causing much animosity among the houses</li>
											<li>When one house threaten to go to <%=Sulymon%> for justice, <%=Iblis%> had the heads of disloyal houses killed</li>
											<li>Those that could, escaped back to their home elemental planes
												<ul class="circle" style="margin-left: 40px;">
													<li>The Emir of <%=Djinn%> and his daughter somehow manage to escape returning to the Elemental Plane of Air, never to return</li>
													<li>The remaining <%=Djinn%> follow their leader and leave the city</li>
													<li>Saddened by the leaving of the <%=Djinn%>, the <%=Marid%> take leave of <%=Mudawwarah_Al_Jin%></li>
												</ul>
											</li>
											<li>The house of <%=Iblis%> now ruled the golden city</li>
										</ul>
									</li>

									<li>Of the Fall of the House of Iblis
										<ul class="circle" style="margin-left: 40px;">
											<li>The job of creation was nearly complete and the gods set about populating it with the 2nd children (elves, dwarves and humans</li>
											<li><%=Iblis%> was furious that the 2nd children were given the universe, while he and his people were only given a city</li>
											<li>They defied the gods, claiming they deserved more</li>
											<li>The gods were shocked and spoke their harsh judgment against <%=Iblis%> and his followers:
												<ul class="circle" style="margin-left: 40px;">
													<li>Flames burst from their bodies</li>
													<li>Their faces became twisted and horns burst from their once proud brows</li>
												</ul>
											</li>
											<li>The gods then turned to the children of <%=Iblis%>, cursing them:
												<ul class="circle" style="margin-left: 40px;">
													<li>Forever more, there were be enmity and distrust between their house and the 2nd children</li>
													<li>Any mortals killed or enslaved by an <%=Efreet%> would be reborn in paradise</li>
													<li>Any <%=Efreet%> bound to a moral's will would be their slave, passed on from father to son, mother to daughter</li>
												</ul>
											</li>
											<li>The gods again turned to <%=Iblis%>
												<ul class="circle" style="margin-left: 40px;">
													<li>They damned him, granting him rulership in Hell</li>
													<li>The ground opened beneath his feet, casting him into the pit of Hell</li>
												</ul>
											</li>
											<li>The gods cast <%=Mudawwarah_Al_Jin%> to the very edge of the Plane of Fire</li>
											<li>The golden city was instantly turned to brass, its gems and riches charred</li>
										</ul>
									</li>

									<li>The Demise of <%=Sulymon%> the Genie and the Rise of <%=Sulymon%> the Prophet
										<ul class="circle" style="margin-left: 40px;">
											<li><%=Sulymon%> was shamed by his children's behavior and wept</li>
											<li>Eons passed as he pondered what had gone wrong</li>
											<li>He prayed and begged <%=Anumon%> for guidance, and eventually, his payers were answered in a vision</li>
											<li><%=Sulymon%> wrought great magic to draw the dark from himself eventually defeating his darker half</li>

											<li>Returning to the <%=City_of_Brass%>, <%=Sulymon%> sought to right the many wrongs:
												<ul class="circle" style="margin-left: 40px;">
													<li>He bound the most evil of the <%=Efreet%> into bottles of brass, stoppering them with lead and the seal of <%=Anumon%></li>
													<li>He sent for <%=Cirrishade%>, his daughter, and wed her to <%=Ashur_Ban%>, one of the few <%=Efreet%> who has not sided with <%=Iblis%></li>
													<li>Placing the two upon the Brass Throne, he left the city</li>
													<li>Calling upon <%=Anumon%>'s might, the <%=Plane_of_Molten_Skies%> formed over his princely head, scorched earth and sand</li>
												</ul>
											</li>
										</ul>
									</li>

									<li>Of the <%=City_of_Brass%> and the Coming of the Usurper
										<ul class="circle" style="margin-left: 40px;">
											<li>Many years passed and relative peace reigned again between <%=Djinn%> and <%=Efreet%></li>
											<li>A truce brokered by the marriage of the Sultana and Sultan brought great prosperity to the city</li>
											<li>But not all of the <%=Efreet%> were satisfied - many despised the Sultana and saw <%=Ashur_Ban%> as weak</li>
											<li>Despite their troubles, the love of <%=Ashur_Ban%> and <%=Cirrishade%> grew stronger with each passing year</li>
											<li>Many children were born to them; and to those children, many grandchildren - they were called the <%=Hawanar%></li>
											<li>Unbeknownst to them, a great evil was taking shape within the <%=Eye_of_Fire%></li>
											<li>There in the <%=Eye_of_Fire%> it forged its weapon for the taking of the universe - a brazen scimitar with which to set the very heavens ablaze</li>
											<li>In the <%=Eye_of_Fire%>, the years passed and the creature grew stronger, quietly gathering evil to its side</li>
											<li>Once gathered, the Usurper struck from the <%=Eye_of_Fire%> capturing <%=Efreeti%> fortresses</li>
											<li>Many among them swore it was <%=Iblis%> returned from Hell to lead them once again</li>
											<li>When the Usurper finally arrived at the <%=City_of_Brass%>, he cast down the gates and slew Sultan <%=Ashur_Ban%> in one blow, shattering the resolve of his forces</li>
											<li>At long last, the Usurper claimed the Throne of Brass and has sat there unchallenged ever since</li>
											<li>Claiming the title of Great Sultan, the Usurper freed the evil servants of <%=Iblis%> from their bondage</li>
											<li>He set the <%=Efreet%> to work collecting numerous slaves for the many tasks, and bade them forge weapons of great destructive power to be sold to the highest bidder</li>

								<li>
									<img src="./images/People/NPCs/Villains/Sithia.png" title="Sithia" class="right" width="168px" height="250px" />
									Several year prior to his expulsion from the <%=College_of_the_Magi%>, the promising student befriended <%=Sithia%>, priestess of <%=Mephistopheles%>
								</li>
								<li>Over time, the evil cleric groomed the young man, guiding him down a dark, hidden path</li>
								<li>The two made a long-term plan to steal key magic items from prominent citizens of the capital and wealth from his family</li>
								<li>Contact was made with the Thieves Guild of <%=Loftwick%>, deals were made and plans were hatched</li>
								<li>When the boy-wizard was expelled from the <%=College_of_the_Magi%>, the two decided to put their plan in motion</li>
								<li>The <%=Night_of_Grand_Thievery%>
									<ul class="circle" style="margin-left: 30px;">
										<li>Contacting the Thieves Guild, the order was given to launch the plan</li>
										<li>Dozens of homes were targeted for theft of magic items - some successful, some not</li>
										<li>As the homes were being robbed, <%=Maflic%> and <%=Sithia%> ritually scarified the boy-wizard's younger brother in the family home</li>
										<li>In exchange for this sacrifice and his sworn devotion, the boy-wizard
											<ul class="circle" style="margin-left: 30px;">
												<li>Was granted advanced powers as a full wizard (went from 0 level to 5th level)</li>
												<li>Was aged from 15 years old to 30 years old</li>
												<li>
													Was introduced to <%=Gunther_Hendel%>, a warlock in the service of <%=Mephistopheles%>

												</li>
												<li>xxx</li>
											</ul>
										</li>
										<li>After looting the family estate of gems, jewelry and gold, and collecting the magic items stolen by the thieves, the evil-doers left <%=Loftwick%></li>
										<li>Using a played-out mine as a base that they had previously stocked with provisions, they trio hunkered down</li>
										<li>Among the magical items stolen were:
											<ul class="circle" style="margin-left: 30px;">
												<li><%=Amulet_of_Proof_Against_Detection_and_Location%></li>
												<li><%=Cloak_of_Invisibility%></li>

												<li><%=Timepiercer%></li>
												<li><%=Mistwalker_Armor%></li>
												<li>xxx</li>
											</ul>
										</li>
										<li>Following the theft of many magic items, the city of <%=Loftwick%> was in a panic</li>
										<li>Those who still had magic held on to it tightly, unwilling to sell any of it</li>
										<li><%=Maflic%> father went mad following the brutal slaying of his son and the theft of much of the family riches</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
								<li>Both <%=Maflic%> and <%=Gunther_Hendel%> have magical means to disguise their appearance</li>
								<li>They never travel to populated areas in their true form, thus, they have not been "seen" in years (and <%=Maflic%> is 15 years older than he should be)</li>
								<li><%=Maflic%> hates the party, esp. <%=Caris%>, <%=Frobo%> and <%=Aerethel%> for getting him expelled from the college</li>
								<li>He is patient, willing to spend years to see his plans play out</li>
								<li>The evil wizard periodically scrys on the party, so is often aware of when they are going to be in the <%=Loftwick%> area (and attacks them)</li>
								<li><%=Maflic%> hired bandits and rogues to harass or kill the party on many of their visits to <%=Loftwick%>, always observing from safety</li>
								<li>He and his party have ambushed the party on occasion, but always had to flee</li>
								<li>On occasion, he has sent an <%=Invisible_Stalker%> to try to kill one of his enemies</li>
								<li>He once possessed a 15 year old girl and battled the party (with others), then broke the spell and escaped when he started to loose</li>
								<li>xxx</li>
							</ul>
						</li>

						<li>After 4-5 years of adventuring in the <%=Loftwick%> region, the villains have temperately left the region seeking magic and wealth</li>
						<li>Being far away, they have not been around <%=Loftwick%> to harass the party when <%=The_Whyme_Pines%> have visited the city in the past year or so</li>
